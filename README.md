# Object-Orientated Programming Vehicles
This repository contains a basic program implementing Java classes for vehicles.

Vehicles help us move from A to B, yet come in many different forms. For example, cars and bicycles have wheels whilst boats don't; some vehicles can carry passengers whilst bikes can't.

## Getting started
To get started with this code, click the `Clone or download` button in the top right, and `Download ZIP`. You can then open the project in Netbeans.

## Exercises 

The classes in this project demonstrate one way of structuring a program for storing and manipulating vehicles within a Java program. After watching the lecture video, try some of the following exercises:

1. Make an object representing a red car
2. Make an array containing five different white vans
3. A coach can be thought of as a bigger minibus, with more seats and more wheels. Extend the `Minibus` class and demonstrate how you can make a new coach.
4. Cruise ships carry lifeboats. Extend the `Boat` class to create a class for lifeboats, and allow these to be included in cruise ships.
5. Some vehicles require number plates, such as `AB12 XYZ`. Add code to the relevant classes to store these number plates in the most efficient way, ensuring they are printed out in the `toString()' method.
6. A train is a completely different form of transport running on rails, and constructed of many individual vehicles. Create a `Train` class that can have multiple `Carriage` objects attached to it.
*Hint: you might want to use a LinkedList format to make this easier to manage. See the [5 minute guide](https://medium.com/@jillplatts/6-minute-beginners-guide-to-java-s-linked-list-data-structure-bb2fbcca81b1) for more details.*
7. A car park contains a number of cars. Make a class to represent a car park with a maximum of 20 spaces.
